<h1>WordPress.org Training Team</h1>
<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
<p>The WordPress Training Team creates downloadable lesson plans and related materials for instructors to use in live workshop environments. If you enjoy teaching people how to use and build stuff for WordPress, immediately stop what youâ€™re doing and join our team!</p>
<p>Regardless of your skill set, you can help! We need people to write, copyedit, test, audit, connect, and review our lesson plans. Find out how to get started.</p>
